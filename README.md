# inferado

Inferado is a toolkit for automatically exposing remote control of a
microcontroller (C++ firmware) through any of several interfaces, e.g., serial
port, I2C, wifi, etc.  Remote control bindings may be automatically generated
for Python, C++, and Javascript (easy to add support for other languages).
